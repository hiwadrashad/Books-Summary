once an API has been written down we call it described

example of a YAML file which shows images of a dog breed

image 2 - 2.png

here the API is hosted at https://dog.ceo/api
- there is a GET operation with the path / breed/{breedName}/images
- this path has a part called breedName and it is a required string
- a succesfull response will give us a JSON array where each item is an object containing message and status fields
- The message field is an array of string that contain the URL's of dog images

once we have an API definition we can use leverage this, the deinfinitions can be created by tools or by extracting annotation from code,
they they can be transformed into API documentation, server stubs/mocks and client SDK's

other workflows could include:
  - Automating parts of API testing
  - geting early feedback on the design of an API
  - ensuring API consistency
  - Comparing API changes across versions

OpenAPI means the ecosystem whereas Swagger are the tools used

There was an old standatf called WADL

SDK templates can be generated trough Swagger CodeGen or OpenAPI Generator which are usually suficient for all langauges,
but more power can be extracted trough customizing and creating tempates specific to your needs

boilerplate code and stubs can be autogenerated trough OpenAPI definitions,
there is also the possiblity such as using OpenAPI definitions during runtime to act as a router (Having API Operation map to classes and methods in code)
or as a validation layer(where incoming requests will fail validation unless they conform to the OpenAPI definition's schema) these are used more
commonly in microservice-oriented architectures

API design is done trough Agile or other fast acting methods, but longetivity should be standard, Design is more important when making multiple API'safer
as consistency plays an important rule when making multiple API's

OpenApi makes the minimal upfront cost of describing it worth it, trough the automation that is available

==================================

low level tools exist for REST API = telnet for HTTP and OpenSSL for HTTPS

Method  URI      Query            params Body
GET     /reviews maxRating (1-5)  N/A


the URI will be placed after the whole URL
e.g:

https:/ /farmstall.designapis.com/v1/reviews

if we add the query parameter we get

https:/ /farmstall.designapis.com/v1/reviews?maxRating=5

GET methods can have body's like POST's but with a size limit, and binary data can't be send

body also allows encryption, a query has the chance that the data would be logged by servers and proxies between your client and server
